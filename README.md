PCEAllyChecks is an extension to the [PiggyCustomEnchants](https://github.com/DaPigGuy/PiggyCustomEnchants/) plugin which utilizes the AllyChecks feature introduced in [v2.1.0](https://github.com/DaPigGuy/PiggyCustomEnchants/pull/257).

Currently, the following plugins are supported:
* [FactionsPE](https://github.com/BlockHorizons/FactionsPE)
* [FactionsPro](https://github.com/poggit-orphanage/FactionsPro)

PCEAllyChecks will prevent certain custom enchants from affecting your faction members/allies:
* AutoAim
* Blaze
* Cactus
* Forcefield
* Homing Arrows
* Lightning
* Poisonous Cloud
* Wither Skull
